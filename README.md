# Hate Speech Detection Against Women and Immigrants on Twitter


### Abstract

Social networks have grown a lot in recent years, a great example is Twitter, which its users send updates (a.k.a., tweets) to a network of associates (a.k.a., followers) from a variety of devices. Because of this growth, not only the way that we communicated has become more practical, there has also been an increase in the exposure of opinions, often controversial and may be offensive, aggressive, rude, hateful, among other derogatory characteristics. In this respect, it has become interesting to develop automatic methods to idendify this type of hate language, and the area called Sentiment Analysis provides several methods for detecting feelings in social networks. Therefore, this article presents a survey on hate speech detection against women and immigrants on Twitter, from a multilingual perspective, English and Spanish. Our research describes several approaches that have been explored to automatically recognize hate speech using machine learning and deep learning. The methods developed were exposed to two tasks, where the first one aims to classify a tweet as hateful or non-hateful, and the second is to idendify the target of hateful speech, in the case of being a single individual or a group of people.
